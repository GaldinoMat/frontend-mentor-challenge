## Overview 💻

### The challenge 🏋️‍♂️

The challenge is to learn front-end development by doing each challenge progressively, thinking about what was used for each solution, why it was used and how I improved/changed from past projects.

## My process 👨‍💻

### What I have learned (so far) 📓

Until now, I've learned that there not only one solution for every problem. Every developer tackles it with a different viewpoint, different skills and different tools. Since I have begun this personal challenge, I
tend to research and gather information on how to achieve a more coherent and modular solution to each challenge, instead of something that only works to that especific project. So far, I am on the Newbie level, but I plan to update this journal and repository with each completed challenge, talking about what I used and learned with my solution.

### Continued development ✏

Newbie level: I plan to study more Javascript, its functionalities and how to have a more functional approach to certain situations. To achieve this, I hope to take on problems that have a heavy emphasis on it, without leaving the usual HTML/CSS3 combo behind.

### Useful resources 📚

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - To anyone who wants to give it a try.

## That is it! ✌

That is it, for now. I plan to continue this project of mine, building this repository and maintaining as a reference not only for me, but to anyone who wants to give frontend development a try and is struggling to
deal with it. The links bellow are avaiable for anyone who wants to contact me!
